        Makes a linear queue with no maximum size.

        You may ask, what's the point of this? isn't this just a normal list?
        Basically, it is; but you have a dequeue method that doesn't error
        when trying to pop an empty list.

        I don't think this is actually needed,
        I also added this to get marks in my A-Level coursework.
        But it works, so I'll keep it :)
