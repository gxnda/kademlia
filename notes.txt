#Searching for peers
You download someone elses' copy of the device, and send your IP to the computer you downloaded it off. 
You then send that IP recursively to each of the IP's the other computer knows and the ones they know etc etc.
This is not secure, as each computer will know all of the other computers IP addresses, Tom just suggested using a system where instead of keeping a list of IP's,
you keep a list of a few IP's, and send a packet to each of them saying "Hi please forward this to all your friends! I want to download this, and I was wondering
if any of you had this installed?" - I'm trying to work out hash algorithms/ work how magnet: URI schemes work to try and make this more secure - I don't know if it 
will though because I don't know how they work yet.
