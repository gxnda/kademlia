Searching for peers:

    You download someone else's copy of the device, and send your IP to the computer you downloaded it off. You then send
that IP recursively to each of the IPs the other computer knows and the ones they know etc.
    This is not secure, as each computer will know all the other computers IP addresses, Tom just suggested using a
system where instead of keeping a list of IPs, you keep a list of a few IPs, and send a packet to each of them saying
"Hi please forward this to all your friends! I want to download this, and I was wondering if any of you had this
installed?" - I'm trying to work out hash algorithms/ work how magnet: URI schemes work to try and make this more
secure - I don't know if it will though because I don't know how they work yet.
