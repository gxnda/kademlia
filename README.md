# What is this?

This originally began as my A-Level Computer Science NEA (coursework), but it's been expanded upon since.

It is mostly an interpretation of 
["The Kademlia Protocol Succinctly"](https://github.com/SyncfusionSuccinctlyE-Books/The-Kademlia-Protocol-Succinctly) 
by Marc Clifton, with a GUI + CLI (The implementation is in Python, rather than C#).

This mostly serves as an introduction to peer-to-peer systems for me, and to get me familiar with version control.

**There are much better implementations of Kademlia out there, this is nowhere near a complete implementation.**

# To-do list

- [x] Make Kademlia implementation
- [x] Make GUI
- [x] Make CLI
- [X] Make all unit tests pass

- [ ] Make error handling more pythonic
- [ ] Add more unit tests for the CLI for input validation
- [ ] Add encryption
- [ ] Make it more usable
- [ ] Create more scalable storage (databases, etc)

- [ ] Actually test it at scale (100+ nodes, on different networks)
- [ ] Make it more efficient
