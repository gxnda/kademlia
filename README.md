# What is this?

This originally began as my A-Level Computer Science NEA (coursework).

It is mostly an interpretation of "The Kademlia Protocol Succinctly" by Marc Clifton, with a GUI + CLI
(The implementation is in Python, rather than C#).

This mostly serves as an introduction to peer-to-peer systems for me.
